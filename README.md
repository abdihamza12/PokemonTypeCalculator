# PokemonTypeCalculator
An application where you search for a type combination and the program will output every pokemon that matches that type combination. 


Hello to those who are reading this!
This is my first github repository and I'm using it to display the first larger project that I've created

Current Issues with the code:
  - The excel spreadsheet that I used to gather data from is only updated up to generation 5 of pokemon (649 / 898 PKMN)
  - Window does not expand when text goes beyond the frame
  - When a generic pokemon type is searched (pure water), the buttons will spread apart from each other.
